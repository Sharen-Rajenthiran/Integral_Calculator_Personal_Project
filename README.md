# Integral_Calculator_Personal_Project


This is a personal project of mine. The goal was to expose myself to solving one-dimensional and three-dimensional integrals using Scipy. This is a work in progress because I am still learning new stuff. I will come back to this project if I find new integrals that interest me.

Thanks for reading!
